# SE-Uni23
This is a project a small project I completed for a University assignment.
This project was deployed using Heroku and the database is stored in Vercel Storage

We were provided a very basic set of conditions our Web Page should've been able to fulfill.
We had the choice to use any tool, technology or language we wanted as long as it worked.

I used this opportunity to further my understanding of JavaScript and to introduce myself to Node, Express, Cookies and other essential things I might use in the future, as Web Development is what I find myself to be more passionate about at this early stage of my career. 
My main focus was to learn more about Backend Dev, so the Design of the site is very basic and functional 'enough'.

The admin panel can we accesed by the username and password (admin:admin)
The admin user can create Students,which are given a generated username and password (firstnamelastnamebirthyear:lastname123)
Admins can create Internships which are displayed to the Students in the Internships tab according to their Faculty.
Admins can resolve Complaints submited by Students in the Complaints tab.

The Students panel can be accesed by the generated username and paswords.
Students can apply for Internships in the Internships tab.
Students can submit complaints in the Complaints tab.

More admins can be created in the PostgreSQL database saved in Vercel Storage
