# SE-Uni23
This is a project a small project I completed for a University assignment. 

We were provided a very basic set of conditions our Web Page should've been able to fulfill.
We had the choice to use any tool, technology or language we wanted as long as it worked.

I used this opportunity to further my understanding of JavaScript and to introduce myself to Node, Express, Cookies and other essential things I might use in the future, as Web Development is what I find myself to be more passionate about at this early stage of my career. 
My main focus was to learn more about Backend Dev, so the Design of the site is very basic and functional 'enough'.
